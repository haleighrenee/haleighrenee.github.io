        <h3>Introduction</h3>
 
        <p>When I made the decision to pursue a career in teaching, I did so because of the
            safety and relationships I found in the classroom as a student. Without many of the
            incredible educators who inspired me, I am unsure of where I would be today. 
            Thus, I knew from the conception of this career plan that the most important part
            of teaching for me would be the connections I make with my students. My teaching 
            philosophy is grounded in two major facets: rhetorical actions and student 
            relationships. </p>
        
        <h3> Rhetorical Value & Relationships </h3>
        <p>In order to teach effectively, I find that it is pertinent to understand one’s own
             rhetorical situation. All of my classroom decisions, whether I actively realize 
             it or not, stem from a rhetorical choice that I am making for myself and for my 
             students. Because teaching is rhetorical in nature, educators must recognize their
            own purpose, audience, and appeal to students. Every class I encounter throughout
            the day has a totally different makeup of students; therefore, my actions and
            interactions must always be rhetorically effective for the audience to which I
            am presenting.  I intend to find a way to effectively present myself to every 
            class of students I happen to be assigned—if I notice a class does not respond well
            to how I present
            information and ideas, then I know to consider how to better reach next time I see
            them. Moreover, I find that in order for students to “buy-in” to my class, they 
            must perceive me as having the credibility and capability to teach them well 
            while also trusting me. I strive to be clear in my expectations and requirements
            so students can trust that my requests of them are purposeful and intentional. 
            I find this also helps to build relationships with students, as my openness with 
            them establishes a clear trusting relationship from the start of each year.</p> 
        
        <p>While I work to situate my content presentation with a clear rhetorical purpose,
         I am also consistently working on building strong relationships with my students. 
         I tell my students often that my goal for them is to learn to communicate more 
         effectively—even if they do not perfect their writing skills in their time with me,
          my hope is that they better understand how to express ideas. In order to build 
          this experience for students, though, they have to feel safe to express themselves 
          in my classroom. I never want students to listen to me simply because they fear me.
          My job is not to scare students into submission, and I always work toward building 
          an environment of safety and acceptance of all students. I cannot expect a student 
          to learn anything from me if their well-being is compromised. This is truly why I 
          put relationship building at the top of my priorities at the start of each year. 
          If I know students well enough, then I can sense when they are having an off day. 
          Strong relationships also help me determine whether students are growing. Many 
          students produce brilliant ideas but struggle with how to showcase their thoughts, 
          so in building relationships with them I know how to build assignments with a choice
           for students to present their learning how they are comfortable; giving a bit of 
        choice and freedom also encourages student engagement.</p>
        
        <p>After establishing strong relationships with students, I find that their level 
        of engagement also improves. English is, unfortunately, not all students’ favorite 
        subject. Often, they enter my classroom dejected from past struggles with reading 
        and writing and they are prepared to face defeat again. I never want students to feel
         stuck in their preconceived ideas of what English class looks like. Returning to my 
         earlier assertion that my main goal is improving communication, I try to focus
        students on their growth. Instead of moving from one assignment to the next with no 
        clarification, we take time for reflecting and learning what we’ve improved upon and 
        what might need work in the future. This helps students, I believe, maintain engagement
         because they are less fearful of failing or embarrassing themselves. I often remind 
         students that English is easier than they might realize because there are no wrong
        answers as long as they support their ideas. This low-pressure nudge tends to help 
         them continue wanting to learn rather than checking out when they dislike a class.</p>
        <h3>Accountability & Safety </h3>
          <p>Although my priority is building relationships, my students know that I 
            hold them to a high standard for active learning and strong writing. While I 
            certainly allow what others might see as chaos (active collaboration and 
            communication), my students know what I expect of them. I encourage “bad” writing: 
            in the early stages of starting a novel or unit, I have my students write their 
            thoughts and ideas before there is any true plan for where that writing may go. 
            Sometimes we revisit it, but sometimes it just serves as a process for getting them
            to continue developing thinking and communication skills. I also incorporate 
            rhetoric in the content I teach my students for this reason. It helps guide 
            them to a stronger level of understanding of their own writing while also showing 
            them why I make the choices I do as their leader. Once they understand the basis 
            of rhetoric, they start to make better assumptions in regard to what they read. 
            I believe when my students begin to make intentional choices in their writing, 
            they begin to hold themselves to a higher standard and put forth the utmost effort.</p> 
            
            <p>I prioritize rhetoric and relationships because I value students 
            understanding the why behind what I ask them to do. I look to my own learning,
            in which I most valued teachers with a clear purpose for teaching certain content,
            and try to emulate what led to my own success. I learned the best from those 
            teachers who gave me respect and created an environment of safety, and I want 
            my students to experience something similar. My hope is that every single student 
            who walks through my door feels safe enough to come to me for help while also 
            learning to grow their communication skills. In an era of ever-rising mental 
            health issues, I do not want any student to feel under-valued or as though 
            they are part of an assembly line of cookie-cutter kids meant to sit and get 
            information and move on to the next part of life. I value their brilliance and 
            silliness, and I hope every student feels safe to be themselves when they are 
            in my classroom.</p>
