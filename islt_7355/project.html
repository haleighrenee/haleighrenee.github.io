          <h3> Project 1: Website & Media Portfolio </h3>
    <strong>Competency: Understand usability, user experience, new technology, communication, and design learning environments</strong><br>
    <em>Reflection:</em> For this project, I created a functional Google Site that integrates a variety 
    of media all with the goal of teaching a specific learning outcome. The project includes 
    an audio explanation of part of the task, an infographic, and then a video description of 
    the task my students were required to complete. In order to fully assess whether the project 
    was successful, I completed a usability test in which I had several colleagues “test” my site for its
     intended functionality. This helped me to catch any bugs along the way, although if I were to do this again,
    I would ensure I create my site in a personal Google account–creating this in my work account led to
    a lot of unforeseen blocks because of district protocol. This also shows competency in creating online learning 
    environments, as this took students through the steps required for achieving their learning goal and also 
    functions with an assessment (although I would not describe this as my most valuable or impressive learning 
    environment, as it lacks some detail that I would add if I were using this for a true class). </a>

    <h3>Project 2: Completed Research on Technology Training in Schools</h3>
    <strong>Competency: Improve Workplace Performance</strong><br>
    <em>Reflection:</em> Reflection: In order to improve workplace performance, 
    especially when focused on educational technology, I explored the impacts of technology training 
    on both educators and students. In both research and interviewing my colleagues and students, it became 
    clear that effective training in Learning Management Systems (LMS) is vital to the implementation of them. 
    While I cannot say that I have improved the workplace for a myriad of teachers by any means, I was able to 
    take this information to the district technology leaders and encourage them to train teachers more effectively. 
    If I were to do this differently, I would follow the same process but follow through on more interviews and observations
     of what skills tend to be missing for both educators and their students in terms of LMS use. </a>

<h3>Project 3: Team Project--Technology Tools for Educators</h3>
<strong>Competency: Learn best practices for needs assessment, task analysis, and course design and development</strong><br>
<em>Reflection:</em>throughout the course Instructional Systems of Design, students 
learned the ADDIE method for instructional design which focuses on exactly this competency: 
needs assessments, task analysis, and course design. While we had various experiences to practice each 
step of design, the culminating task led to the creation of the attached guide. This guide includes functional
 professional development training that guides teachers in how to evaluate and implement technology tools 
 (mostly applications) within their classrooms. In order to best serve teachers, it was necessary to complete
  a thorough needs and task analysis before creating the lessons and training to be used. This project was a 
  huge undertaking and though at times it felt overwhelming, I cannot say I would change a thing. The team I 
  collaborated with was incredibly helpful and engaged throughout the genesis of our guide. What I do take away 
  from this, though, is how incredibly important a task and needs analysis is–though not always something educators
  have enough time to complete as thoroughly as I would hope, it makes a huge difference in creating sound design 
  for a lesson or course.<br> </a>
