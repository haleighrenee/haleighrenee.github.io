<h4>Welcome To My Portfolio!</h4>
<p>I am a lifelong <em>learner</em> and <em>educator</em> with a passion for technology. 
    I love writing and creating, and my page will tell you all about my endeavors as a learner.</p>
<p>
    
    This page previews my competency and experience with creating content, 
    educating, and learning as a student myself. 
    You will be able to peruse a variety of projects that I have worked on both 
    individually and in collaborative settings while also viewing my personal reflection on each task.
    The site also provides insight into my qualifications and abilities that make me an asset to any 
    technology or education team, as you can browse my Curriculum Vitae, my teaching philosophy,
    and the jobs I have held as an educator. 
    The goal of this portfolio is to showcase the valuable skills and knowledge 
    I have and can add to a team. I love designing content for my students and to exemplify my own learning,
    and I believe this portfolio makes that clear to any who view my page.
