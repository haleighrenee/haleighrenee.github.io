                 <p>  Hello, I am Haleigh! I was born and raised in the <strong>Kansas City, Missouri</strong> area 
                and currently reside in Lee’s Summit–just outside the metro. I have experience teaching all 
                levels of high school English. This is my 6th year as an educator. When I am not spending my 
                time grading, planning, or hanging out in my classroom, I’m likely with my husband and dogs.<br> 
                I married my husband, Kyle, in 2016. We have two dogs, Albus and Dobby, and they occupy most of 
                our free time. Our favorite pastime is walking them around the neighborhood. We enjoy anything 
                involving science-fiction or superheroes. If we aren’t doing anything already mentioned, then we’re
                likely out for a run or enjoying dinner on a local patio.</p> 
                <p>Outside of all the excitement of teaching and being a dog mom, 
                I am also a <em>student.</em> I earned my Bachelor of Arts in English from Avila University
                in Kansas City. After getting my first two years of teaching under my belt, 
                I decided to return to the classroom. I earned my Master of Arts in English from Emporia State 
                University in 2020 (right as the pandemic hit). Finally, because I learned to <em>love</em> 
                virtual teaching, I enrolled in my current program at the University of Missouri. 
                I am working toward an Education Specialist in Information Science and Learning Technologies 
                with an emphasis in Online Education. I will graduate in December 2022.
