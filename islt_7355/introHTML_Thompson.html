    Hello! I’m Haleigh Thompson. I was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. 
    I am a high school English teacher and have experience teaching various levels of students each year. 
    This is my 6th year teaching. While this takes up much of my time, I am also a student. 
    During the height of the pandemic, I earned my Master of Arts in English. 
    Then, I enjoyed teaching online so much that I enrolled to earn another degree through Mizzou. 
    This helps to propel me toward my future career hopes of teaching virtually. 
    If all goes as planned, I will graduate in December this year with my Education Specialist degree. 
   
    I married my husband 6 years ago, and we have two dogs who occupy most of our free time. 
    We love to take them for walks around the neighborhood. We also enjoy watching anything involving science-fiction or superheroes. 
    If we aren’t doing any of that, we are likely out for a run or enjoying dinner on a local patio. 
    Another favorite hobby is playing Pokémon Go (even if it seems like everyone else stopped playing)!
    I do not have any experience with web development unless you count when I learned to fully code my Myspace page back in 2007.
    Those skills are mostly in remission now, though. 
    
    Through this course, I hope to understand the basics of HTML and CSS because I am fascinated by learning the back end of how websites are created and present information.
    I’m very excited (and nervous) about this course.
